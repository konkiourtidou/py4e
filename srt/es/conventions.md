# Translation conventions
## Introduction
We will use this document to make the same conventions so different people can translate in a cohesive way. 
* We will try to make this one a spanish latino translation.
* We will respect punctuation as it is in the original english subtitle.

## Resources
The single source of truth will be the book translation. If we have doubts with some terms we will find the term in the english book and check the spanish version.
