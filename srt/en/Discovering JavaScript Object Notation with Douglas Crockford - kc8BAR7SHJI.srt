1
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,129
so Jason was the world's best loved data

2
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,520
interchange format it I discovered it in

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,699
2001 I don't claim to have invented it

4
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,500
because it already existed in nature I

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,769
just saw it and recognized the value of

6
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,540
it gave it a name in a description and

7
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,240
showed its benefits but I did not invent

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,890
it I don't claim to be the first person

9
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,200
to have discovered it there were other

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,510
people who I later found out had come

11
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,050
along the same idea in 2000 the earliest

12
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,420
instance I found of JavaScript being

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,670
used as a data interchange format was at

14
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,210
Netscape in 1996 so it's an idea that's

15
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,220
been around for a while and if you look

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,760
at other data representations like the

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,250
property lists that were used at next

18
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,560
and then reader at Apple except for a

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020
couple of cosmetic changes it's the JSON

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,000
notation as well so it seems like it's

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,270
an inevitable sort of representation for

22
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,850
data at least data that is intended to

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,310
be consumed by programming languages and

24
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,039
ultimately that's all data I started

25
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,530
with JavaScript but my first application

26
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,250
was facilitating communication between

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,450
programs written in JavaScript and

28
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,810
servers written in Java so I recognized

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,130
that even though it was born out of

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,439
JavaScript it could be and should be

31
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,149
language independent so I simplified it

32
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,930
as much as possible to as much out tried

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,840
to make the simplest possible

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,060
specification for how to structure data

35
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,180
and put it on the wire and that

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:27,930
ultimately became called Jason

37
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,450
in 2001 I was at a company that started

38
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,890
called state software and we developed a

39
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,349
platform for doing applications which

40
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,060
could be delivered through unmodified

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,920
web browsers what today is called Ajax

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,680
but in 2001 that was kind of a radical

43
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,400
idea and not many people would believe

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,470
that was the impossible were that were

45
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,129
that it was a good idea but we produce

46
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:56,200
some brilliant demonstrations and we

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,700
were starting to make some progress in

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,190
trying to convince potential customers

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,599
that they should adopt the style of

50
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,930
application development and as part of

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,640
the description we'd say and then we use

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,650
this JSON idea for communicating the

53
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,780
stuff back and forth they say Jason

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,790
what's that so it's this thing we found

55
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,120
in JavaScript it's really great and I

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,940
said oh we can't use that we just

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,090
committed to XML so that we can't visit

58
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,220
but XML is wrong for all of these

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,530
reasons it's it's hugely expensive it's

60
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,230
much harder to use all that well we

61
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,209
can't use that thing you did because

62
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,190
it's not a standard I said it is a

63
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,040
standard it's a proper subset of equi -

64
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,650
6 - which is a standard they signal that

65
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,709
that's not standard so I decided if I

66
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,410
want to be able to use this thing I need

67
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,900
to make it a standard so I bought JSON

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,569
org and put up a web page and sort of

69
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,989
declare it it's a standard that's it

70
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,630
that's all I did I didn't go around

71
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,980
trying to convince industry in

72
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,810
government and and everybody that this

73
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,579
is what they should do I just put up a

74
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:03,239
website basically one page website and

75
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,500
over the years people discovered it and

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,269
then realized oh yeah this is so much

77
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:14,319
easier I'm just going to do that

78
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,880
the thing I never understood about XML

79
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,930
for data interchange

80
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,358
okay so basic generally the pattern is

81
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,850
you've got a query you send it to the

82
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,240
server

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,280
it gives it to the database and you get

84
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,440
back this XML thing and then you have to

85
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,990
send queries to that in order to get the

86
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,860
data out of it

87
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,479
yes it's why can't you just give it to

88
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,300
me in a form where I know what it is and

89
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,060
I can use it immediately and so that was

90
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,889
the the main benefit of Jason I think

91
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,010
wasn't that curly braces are so much

92
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,539
better than angle brackets I mean

93
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,850
ultimately that none of that matters the

94
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,350
thing that mattered was that the data

95
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,240
structures that Jason likes to represent

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,220
are exactly the same data structures

97
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,800
that programming languages represent you

98
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,840
know when Ajax was formulated the X and

99
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,479
Ajax was supposed to be for XML and the

100
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,310
smart kids right away realized well this

101
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,960
is too hard we don't want to be doing

102
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,770
XML here and some of them discovered hey

103
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,300
you can use Jason here instead and it is

104
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,139
so much easier so much faster um so they

105
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:13,340
start doing that and for a while there

106
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,530
was a debate and we're some people were

107
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,500
arguing Jesse James Garrett said the X

108
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,780
stands for XML so you can't use anything

109
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,320
but XML that didn't last very long there

110
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,120
were a number of other alternatives to

111
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,130
XML that were being considered around

112
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,889
those times but Jason was the only one

113
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,669
that was designed specifically for Ajax

114
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,020
probably the boldest design decision I

115
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,940
made in designing Jason was to not put a

116
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,860
version number on it so there is no

117
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,610
mechanism for revising it so Jason were

118
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,440
stuck with it but whatever it is in its

119
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,650
current form that's it and that turns

120
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,039
out to be its best feature because it's

121
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,650
it wants to be a low-level thing I mean

122
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,710
it's it's basic infrastructure it's the

123
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,270
thing that you pile everything else on

124
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,639
you know it's sort of the equivalent of

125
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,990
alphabet you know language you know we

126
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,550
might make up lots of words and lots of

127
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,979
ways of having sentences but it's very

128
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,630
uncommon to make up new letters and

129
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,930
that's sort of the place where Jason

130
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:13,789
lives so it's good that it's not going

131
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:14,270
to change

132
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,509
I expect maybe someday

133
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:20,659
we'll find that there are really

134
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:22,340
important things that Jason doesn't do

135
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,979
like cyclical structures graphs are not

136
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,279
easily represented in Jason they can be

137
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:30,409
but it requires a level of indirection a

138
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:31,819
little bit more work someday we might

139
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:33,469
decide we don't want to do that work and

140
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:35,569
then we replace Jason with something

141
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,939
else we will not extend Jason to do that

142
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,059
we'll replace Jason and even after we do

143
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,009
that replacement everything that was

144
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:45,379
ever developed that still uses Jason

145
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,449
will still work because Jason will never

146
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,930
change
