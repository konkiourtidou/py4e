1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,532
- [Charles] So hello!

2
00:00:01,532 --> 00:00:02,629
Welcome to Python for Everybody,

3
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:05,596
I'm Charles Severance, your instructor.

4
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:07,510
In this assignment, I mean in this video,

5
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,967
I want to work through exercise 2.2.

6
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:16,199
And it's just a basic
hello kind of hello world.

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,672
So I'm going to show you how
I want to do these things.

8
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:22,846
And I've got this folder
called Python for Everybody,

9
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:26,775
and I'm gonna use the Adam text editor.

10
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:28,650
So the whole thing is it's supposed

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,959
to say hello, enter your name.

12
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,076
There's the last one we did.

13
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,383
Okay, so I'm gonna make
in Python for Everybody

14
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:38,788
I'm gonna make a new folder.

15
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:48,346
New folder, and I'm gonna
say ex zero two, zero two.

16
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:55,139
Make myself an exercise, and
I'm going to create a new file.

17
00:00:55,139 --> 00:01:00,429
And I wanna say print hello.

18
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,982
And I'm gonna save file, save as,

19
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:05,943
and it's important to get
these in the right folder.

20
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:12,572
And so I'm gonna call
this ex zero two dot py.

21
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,076
Always end these in Python

22
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:16,832
because then you get
the syntax highlighting.

23
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:19,692
Okay, so now... (sighs)

24
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,170
Again you're not gonna like this

25
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,303
but I want you to learn
to execute these things

26
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:29,272
using the tool, the real tools
that we're gonna really use

27
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,122
because when you're applying this,

28
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:34,285
I want you to know how
to actually do real work.

29
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:36,957
So I need to get to the point
where this Terminal program,

30
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:40,880
and I can say start run Terminal.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,821
That's another way to get
the Terminal program started,

32
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:45,014
but I've got it down here in my dock,

33
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:47,006
so that saves me some time.

34
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,679
And of course if you're on Windows,

35
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,720
this is the command prompt.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,384
And so in Windows you'd type cd,

37
00:01:53,384 --> 00:01:55,854
but in Mac I type pwd and that shows

38
00:01:55,854 --> 00:01:59,362
where I am at in the directory structure.

39
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:01,707
And I can go into my desktop.

40
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,604
This would work the same.

41
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:05,100
And I can do an ls.

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,584
In Windows I would say der,

43
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:14,944
and I see this desktop folder.

44
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:18,615
And I'm gonna go into py4e
and if I keep doing pwd,

45
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:20,390
you see I'm navigating deeper and deeper

46
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,783
into this directory structure.

47
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,920
And then I do an ls here,

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,981
and I'm gonna cd one more
time and if to a folder.

49
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,530
Oh, I did that really quick

50
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,036
and didn't tell you what I was doing.

51
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:34,764
Cd ex tab, so that's because if

52
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:37,196
the name of the file or folder is unique,

53
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:39,691
you can hit the tab in the command line.

54
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:46,165
And away we go, so now
we're in this folder.

55
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,999
In the user's folder py4e desktop,

56
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,826
py4e ex zero two zero two.

57
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:52,677
And then if I say ls...

58
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:54,553
And that's where you wanna get to.

59
00:02:54,553 --> 00:02:55,533
You wanna get to where you know

60
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,208
where you're at in the folder structure

61
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,654
and you know the file
that you're going to run.

62
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:01,605
And I've saved, and so if I save

63
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:07,506
python three ex zero two dot py, it runs.

64
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:09,912
And now I know that what I'm doing

65
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:12,510
in this screen can be run in this screen.

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,359
And oh, I did that again.

67
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,836
I hit the up arrow and I can run it again.

68
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:20,070
So you'll find that the way
you write these programs

69
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,043
is you write them here,

70
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:25,507
and then write them
here and run them here.

71
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:27,636
And again there are shortcuts,

72
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,951
and those are crutches
and you might like them

73
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:34,138
but I just want you to learn
how to use your computer

74
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:36,979
like a real person uses the computer

75
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:40,724
because when we start dealing
with databases and files,

76
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:43,079
you're gonna wanna know where
you're at on your computer.

77
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,611
And so if there's some
fancy clicky button thing

78
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,848
that says automatically run Python,

79
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,560
that's convenient but I want
you to know all this stuff.

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,818
Okay enough about...
(laughs)

81
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:53,906
Well probably I'll just keep talking

82
00:03:53,906 --> 00:03:58,194
about that all the time.

83
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:02,091
So now that we've got our problem.

84
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:04,879
Write a program that uses input to prompt

85
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,639
for their user name and welcomes them.

86
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,901
So this is pretty simple.

87
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,111
Go back to Adam, come one Adam.

88
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:21,416
Okay, so we have to have a variable, nzt.

89
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,483
Later we'll talk about
choosing variable names.

90
00:04:24,483 --> 00:04:27,420
Right now I'm gonna choose
a crazy variable name.

91
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,030
Input is a function and
then you put a prompt,

92
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:37,043
and that's supposed to be enter your name,

93
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,074
colon, and I'm gonna put a space in there.

94
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:49,510
So I'm gonna save that,
and just run it for yucks.

95
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,526
And there you go.

96
00:04:50,526 --> 00:04:51,359
That's one thing you'll get used to

97
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,811
is just typing gibberish really quick.

98
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:56,469
And then we're gonna say print.

99
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:57,671
What do we gotta say here?

100
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:02,225
Print hello.

101
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:08,140
(types on the computer)

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,647
And go pull that variable back out,

103
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:14,125
save that command s,
is how I'm savin' that,

104
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,592
save command s, I saved it.

105
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:20,195
So I didn't make file save,
but I could've said file save

106
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:25,599
but command s saves it,
and now I can run it again.

107
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:28,747
Zap. Hello zap.

108
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,061
So now I can run my thing.

109
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:32,194
Oh and command k clears it.

110
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:33,753
I don't remember what it is on Windows,

111
00:05:33,753 --> 00:05:36,547
but there's a way to clear your screen.

112
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:41,110
I like to keep my screens clean.

113
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,109
Hello chuck.

114
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:48,947
And so we have completed exercise
2.2 with a little program.

115
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,514
Oh and by the way, I'm using alt tab.

116
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:55,244
When you see this, I'm
using the alt command tab

117
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:58,097
and the same thing works
on Windows as alt tab.

118
00:05:58,097 --> 00:06:00,535
Okay?

119
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:03,050
Okay, so I hope that was helpful to you.

120
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,913
Just to kind of walk through
one of the assignments,

121
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:09,163
assignment 2.2 in Python for Everybody.
