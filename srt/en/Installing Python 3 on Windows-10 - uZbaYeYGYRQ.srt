1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,647
- Hello and welcome to my video.

2
00:00:03,647 --> 00:00:05,384
This shows how to get started

3
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:10,607
and install Python on
Microsoft Windows, okay?

4
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:12,273
So it's not too hard.

5
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,734
We're gonna both install Python 3

6
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,198
and we're going to install text editor.

7
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:20,094
And so I'm just gonna go into Google

8
00:00:20,094 --> 00:00:23,765
and I'm gonna type install Python 3.

9
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:27,683
And my top link is downloading Python.

10
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:32,348
And there is my link for
downloading Python 3.5.2.

11
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:35,074
This version of my class uses Python 3.

12
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:38,016
I have an earlier class
that you may have seen

13
00:00:38,016 --> 00:00:39,086
that uses Python 2

14
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:41,281
but in this class we're going to do this.

15
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,030
Now it might take you a
while to download this.

16
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,057
I've actually downloaded it.

17
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,346
Now the other thing we need

18
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,818
is a programmer text editor.

19
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:52,160
And you can really use any
programmer text editor.

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,062
We've used Notepad+ in the past.

21
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,777
We've used jEdit in the past.

22
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:58,025
I like Atom.

23
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,677
Atom.io.

24
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:01,980
Tom.io.

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,699
Mostly because it works the same

26
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,953
on Windows and Mac and Linux.

27
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:10,995
But you can really use any
text editor that you like.

28
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:13,911
Just don't use Word

29
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:16,638
or text edit that comes
with the operating system.

30
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:18,075
You need a programmers editor

31
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:20,829
that doesn't mess with weird characters

32
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,822
or weird lines or strange formats.

33
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:27,490
You must have a real programmer editor.

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,032
I've already downloaded this as well.

35
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:34,941
And so I won't waste the
time waiting to download it.

36
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:37,109
But let's go ahead and
do the installation.

37
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,975
So,

38
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,295
these things,

39
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:45,877
these things ended up in my

40
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:47,981
my downloads file.

41
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:49,720
So I'll go to downloads.

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,527
And I'll start installing Python 3.5.2.

43
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,949
Now it's gonna ask me some things.

44
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:00,202
Add Python 3.5 to the path.

45
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:01,241
And that's a good idea.

46
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:02,882
Install the launcher for all you users.

47
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:04,752
I'm going to add that.

48
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,813
Maybe you will, maybe you won't do that.

49
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:14,070
It's gonna tell me where
it's gonna install it.

50
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,114
Install now.

51
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:18,134
Of course it's gonna ask me

52
00:02:18,134 --> 00:02:21,350
for permission to do these things.

53
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,189
And now it's running
through the installation.

54
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:26,336
Okay, so, there we go.

55
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:27,834
You can maybe click on this

56
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,728
online tutorial and documentation.

57
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:34,738
But we're just going to close this.

58
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,522
And I'm gonna start and run
the Windows command line.

59
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:43,364
Now you may have all kinds
of fancy ways to run Python.

60
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:47,722
But I like running the command line

61
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:50,521
c, o, m, m, a, n, d.

62
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,095
I like running the command line

63
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:55,984
because it's after a while
it's important to know

64
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:59,253
what folder things are being run in.

65
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,296
And so here's this command line.

66
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:04,388
And I should be able to type Python here.

67
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:07,106
And so now I'm in Python 3.2.

68
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:10,562
And this is the chevron prompt here

69
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,317
is the Python interpreter

70
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,574
where it's asking for Python commands.

71
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:19,657
And I can say print.

72
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,279
Hello world.

73
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,914
Of course this is what we tend to print

74
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,386
all the time.

75
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:26,541
I can make a mistake.

76
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:34,948
I can say (making gibberish sounds).

77
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:35,781
Right?

78
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,267
And it'll complain to me.

79
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,309
Now to get out of this,

80
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,241
I can either type control Z or quit.

81
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,292
And in this case, I'm
gonna type control Z.

82
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:43,758
And I'm back to the prompt.

83
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,967
Couple of things.

84
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,529
I can do a dir to see what
folders and files I have

85
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,363
and that is like my desktop.

86
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:56,566
And then the cd command tells
me where I'm at in the folder

87
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:58,879
that means I'm in the users directory,

88
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,818
drchuck, okay?

89
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:04,061
So I have now installed Python.

90
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,479
I ran the Python interpreter to verify it.

91
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,570
I said print hello world.

92
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,280
Okay, so now what I'm going to do

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,087
is I'm gonna actually install Atom.

94
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,335
I already had this downloaded

95
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:25,783
so let's go ahead and
install Atom on my computer.

96
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:26,616
Okay.

97
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:29,040
So Atom is now installed in this kind of

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,470
telling us what to do.

99
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,478
I'm gonna actually just
close all these windows.

100
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,953
Close this window, close everything.

101
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:38,386
And I'm gonna create a file.

102
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:40,748
I'm going to say print,

103
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,059
in this case.

104
00:04:42,059 --> 00:04:46,430
Let's see if I can make this...

105
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,283
Bigger.

106
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:48,814
I can make it bigger.

107
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,506
So I'm gonna type print,

108
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:54,245
hello from a file.

109
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,745
Okay.

110
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:58,135
And I'm gonna save this.

111
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:02,352
I'm gonna save file...

112
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,307
Save as.

113
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:05,672
And what I'm gonna do,

114
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:11,440
is I'm gonna go to my desktop.

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,603
And I'm gonna make a
folder on the desktop.

116
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm gonna call this folder py4e.

117
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,998
So I now have a folder on the desktop.

118
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:25,491
Move this here, I'll move this here.

119
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,510
Oops.

120
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,031
And I'm gonna go into py4e.

121
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:32,266
And then I'm gonna name this file,

122
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:37,469
first.py.

123
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,354
And you'll notice that whey I saved this,

124
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:42,686
when I saved this,

125
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:45,142
it syntax highlighted it.

126
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:47,848
It's one of the nice things
about a program editor.

127
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,302
Okay, and so it says,
it's got a suffix of .py

128
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:53,930
so therefore it knows that it's supposed

129
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,476
to look pretty with Python
and make this one color

130
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:57,695
and make this another color.

131
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,109
The other thing that you'll notice

132
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,346
is that now I have a folder called pye.

133
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:06,283
And if I am in this command line.

134
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,717
Let me just start that up again.

135
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:12,906
I'll show you how to start
the command line again.

136
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:15,631
Command.

137
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:19,240
Now if I do a dir, I see
the folders that I'm in

138
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,263
and one of the folders
that you can see here

139
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,720
is the desktop folder.

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,603
So I'm gonna say cd Desktop.

141
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:28,402
And then I'm gonna type the dir command

142
00:06:28,402 --> 00:06:30,795
to see what folders are in the desktop.

143
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:35,096
These folders are the
same as these folders.

144
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,960
These things are kinda virtual folders.

145
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,069
Py4e is py4e.

146
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:42,793
Now I can type cd which
stands for change directory.

147
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:45,863
Py4e.

148
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,982
And I can do a dir and I see first.py.

149
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:53,322
And that's the same as if
I'm diving into this folder.

150
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,275
Here's this file, first.py.

151
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:59,147
Windows hides the suffix
which is somewhat annoying

152
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,415
and frustrating.

153
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,139
But that's suffix is there.

154
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,676
That file is there.

155
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,018
And so for me, one of the things

156
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:08,359
you gotta figure out in Windows

157
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,006
is how to make sure that you are

158
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:11,761
in the same folder,

159
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,850
Users\drchuck\Desktop\py4e

160
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,939
and that's the name of this file.

161
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,851
And here as well.

162
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,669
And now I'm gonna run this program.

163
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,838
I'm gonna type Python,

164
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:27,212
first.py.

165
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:30,078
And you see that it ran the Python code.

166
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:30,963
Okay?

167
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:34,359
Another way you can do this

168
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,509
is that you can type first.py.

169
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:39,766
And that's because this file
association has happened.

170
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:41,679
This doesn't work in Macintosh.

171
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,150
This only works in Windows.

172
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,779
That all files with .py
are expected to be Python.

173
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,957
And it knows the Python
interpreter where to run.

174
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:50,790
Okay?

175
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,079
And I've got Python 3.0 installed.

176
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,844
And that gets me started.

177
00:07:55,844 --> 00:08:00,756
And so I hope that this
little introduction

178
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,230
about getting things started

179
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,973
and writing your first Python program

180
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:06,056
has been helpful to you.
