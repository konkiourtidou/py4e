00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,600
hello and welcome to

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
the graduation ceremony for my mooc i'm

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
of course dr charles severance uh

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,279
and i'm your instructor and i'll be

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,359
awarding you your certificate

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,000
when the time comes i really appreciate

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,120
the fact that you've

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
stuck with the class long enough to get

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,800
a to get a certificate

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,360
um but as is traditional with

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
graduations we have a graduation speaker

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,000
and he's

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
my good friend and colleague kurt bonk

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,320
from indiana university

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
and so before we do the graduation

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
ceremony i would like to

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
have our graduation speaker talk briefly

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,039
kurt

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,239
this is going to be a pc talk

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,920
there you go what does that mean well

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
politically correct for one thing i got

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
my red indiana glasses and my

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
blue michigan go blue shirt on

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,680
it's partly about what i'll call not

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,159
personal computers another pc word

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,759
but possible courses meaning possible

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,360
paths not next courses you're going to

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
take with dr choc

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,400
necessarily but i'm going to walk you

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
through four p words

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,479
four c words for your possible courses

32
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,759
in life

33
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,119
this course this mooc was about

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,960
your passion your interests what you

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
decided to do

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,960
you moved into an area maybe a new area

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,079
that's within

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,479
your comfort zone or maybe a bit beyond

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,200
it

40
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
but you're trying to find your element

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,159
in life as sir ken robinson says we're

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
all looking for our personal element

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,640
right

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
so number one passion you have to be

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,759
passionate about

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
your course interests and what you

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
explore as part of passion you can't

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,640
just be passionate

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,399
and expect to succeed in life you need a

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
purpose you need a goal you need to be

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,159
moving towards something

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,479
as this professor at stanford talks

53
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
about the highest goal

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
maybe this course you took wasn't your

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
highest goal but it was

56
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
a goal nonetheless and we're all moving

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
towards that so we want to have

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
purpose you want to have passion but the

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
only way you're going to get through a

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,920
mooc

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
is to have persistence or grit you

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
push your way through it persevere in

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,160
that class

64
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,319
find that extra energy inside and i want

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,080
to congratulate all of you for finding

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,560
that

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,319
you've got your passion right you found

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,840
your purpose hopefully even just a

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
course related purpose

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,319
and persistence perseverance grit

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,680
that's the number one word today in

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,319
psychology number four

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,040
of course you're in this class so you

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
have to have a little bit of

75
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
playfulness along the way you know i got

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
into mooking stents when i did my mooc

77
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,000
every weekend take a look at it online

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
but i have a little playfulness in my

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,319
mooc

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
four p words keep those in mind as you

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
proceed

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
another p word into life and your

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
possible courses in your life

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
c words of course you chose

85
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,440
to get involved choice it's your c word

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,640
you got autonomy

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
it's your personal decision to get into

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
this class and complete

89
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,319
that class another c word but commitment

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,879
the second c word i want to focus on you

91
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,360
not only

92
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
decided or chose you committed to it

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,680
to completing this course and that

94
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,319
when you come when you did that all your

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,519
peers were watching you

96
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,360
and talking to you and sharing with you

97
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,120
and next word

98
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
connections a c mooc a connectivist mooc

99
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,319
and

100
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,040
any class online is about connections in

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,400
relationships

102
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
hopefully you didn't just finish this

103
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
class you form

104
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,920
new bridges new relationships new

105
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
possible

106
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,599
pathways possible courses in your life

107
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,680
and so those connections you have might

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,319
help you

109
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,720
down the road anywhere not just for the

110
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,519
content

111
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,599
here but maybe it'll help you get a new

112
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,439
job somewhere or find out about a new

113
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,080
interest

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,959
right and then what is this about some

115
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,599
of you

116
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,000
will want the certificate you're going

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,879
to want this

118
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
some of you want your million dollars

119
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,000
well

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,519
maybe you won't make a million from this

121
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
taking this class or all your classes

122
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:11,920
but

123
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,400
what you will do is maybe like steve

124
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
jobs become innovative the book i'm

125
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
listening to now in my car

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,440
and i just finished defining your

127
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
element

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,759
you have completed a course you might

129
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,080
get a certificate another c word

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,000
so those are the four p words passion

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,040
persistence purpose and playfulness

132
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,680
and the four c words we move through

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,639
choice

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,479
right you want to have some choice in

135
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
your life commitment

136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
to things that you do choose to to

137
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,320
pursue

138
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
and relationships or connections and

139
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,919
finally completion

140
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,639
a course a certificate and you move on

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
in life

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
if you can keep those eight principles

143
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,000
in mind as

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,479
you proceed into other courses i think

145
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,000
maybe you'll find some

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,919
future successes i hope you do i hope

147
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
you follow your heart

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,759
into additional courses with dr chuck or

149
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,039
with other people

150
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,000
so i congratulate all of you on not only

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,039
signing up

152
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
but on completing as many of the modules

153
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,720
and maybe all of them

154
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,199
so you can get your certificate not just

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,280
here but your life certificate as a

156
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,039
open learner and informal now formal

157
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,000
learning thank you very much

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
outstanding outstanding um so i really

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
want to thank curt for coming

160
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,120
here to ann arbor he came all the way up

161
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
from bloomington um

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
and so kurt and i have done a number of

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,080
things together just to be here with

164
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,800
chuck you know

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
no that wasn't yeah he had another

166
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,240
reason to be here so we figured we would

167
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
tape this

168
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,479

169
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,280
walk in front of your computer and uh

170
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,840
receive

171
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,960
your fake graduation certificate i mean

172
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,360
there's

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,639
a little known fact that when you

174
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,080
actually graduate from college they

175
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,440
don't actually give you

176
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
the real certificate they give you a

177
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
carefully rolled up piece of paper with

178
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
a little bow on it

179
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
and then you get to your seat and you

180
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,759
open it up and it's blank but that's

181
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,199
what we're going to do again and you you

182
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
can print your own certificate

183
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
or badge depending on the course that
