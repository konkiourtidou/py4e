00:00:01,574 --> 00:00:03,366
- [Instructor] Hello, and
welcome to Python for Everybody.

2
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:04,750
My name is Charles Severence.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,316
In this short video I will be explaining

4
00:00:07,316 --> 00:00:09,961
how to run Exercise 2.3

5
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:13,306
where we prompt for some
Hours, prompt for some Rate,

6
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,630
and multiply them together
and print them out

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,402
with a little paid message.

8
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,409
So this is 2.3.

9
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,730
Some of you will immediately

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,117
want to go to the Autograder

11
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:26,271
and do your homework on the Autograder.

12
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:29,088
I really would rather you didn't do that

13
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:34,460
unless of course you're doing
this on an iPad or an Android

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,437
or something where you
can't install Python.

15
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,503
But you have to realize that
the Autograder isn't forever.

16
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:42,377
You can only go so far with the Autograder

17
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:45,479
and eventually you have to
write a real Python program.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,462
So I'll eventually show you
how to run this in Autograder

19
00:00:48,462 --> 00:00:50,787
but I'm gonna instead show you how to

20
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:53,236
run it in the terminal.

21
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:57,069
So I'm first gonna go into my
Python for Everybody folder

22
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,744
and I'm gonna make a new folder.

23
00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:00,658
Command+shift+N is what I just did there,

24
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:04,700
ex_02_03 for Exercise 3.

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,070
And so there's Exercise 3.

26
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,392
And I'm also gonna go into Atom

27
00:01:09,392 --> 00:01:12,818
which is my text editor

28
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:16,731
and see, I have that folder.

29
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:20,159
So I'm gonna make a new file

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,854
and I will say print,

31
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:27,190
I'll just say ("PY4E")

32
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:30,782
and then I'll say File, Save As,

33
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:33,067
and I want to make sure it's in here,

34
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:37,510
and it's gonna be ex_02.

35
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,592
I don't like putting spaces in file names.

36
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:41,754
Some operating systems can handle them

37
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:43,999
but that's why I'm using underscores here.

38
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:47,553
So I would avoid using
spaces in file names.

39
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:51,878
So as soon as I give that a ("PY4E"),

40
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,675
as soon as I give it a
Python suffix, I'm there.

41
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:58,039
And so it shows up there in my desktop.

42
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,810
And now I'm gonna run the terminal program

43
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,214
so that I can get there.

44
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:05,868
So, cd Desktop,

45
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:10,538
cd Python for Everybody, that's
the folder on my desktop,

46
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,047
and if I even do an ls, I see
a couple folders and a file.

47
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,784
We can say ls minus l and
see a little more detail

48
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:20,154
that these two are folders

49
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:21,833
and this one's a file.

50
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:27,800
So, change directory, cd ex_02_03.

51
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,492
And so now I'm in that folder

52
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,901
and if I do an ls minus
l, I see that file.

53
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,167
I can also do an ls without
the minus l and see the file.

54
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,537
And now I say,

55
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:46,141
python3 ex_02_03.py,

56
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:46,998
and it runs.

57
00:02:46,998 --> 00:02:50,165
You'll see me, no matter
how many times you watch me,

58
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:52,288
you'll see the first thing that I do

59
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,759
is get to the point where I
know I'm in the right directory

60
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,552
and I can run a little hello
program before I start coding.

61
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:04,083
I just don't like being crazy, right?

62
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:08,782
So now I'm gonna go back and
take a look at my assignment.

63
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:11,680
Enter Hours, you gotta prompt
for hours, ask for a number.

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,349
Enter Rate, prompt for rate,
and then calculate pay.

65
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,609
So there's a couple of
input statements here.

66
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,934
xh is my variable I'm gonna choose.

67
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,226
Later I'll choose more effective variables

68
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:27,150
but for now I'm gonna make them silly.

69
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,107
Enter Hours colon space

70
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:34,943
and then I'm gonna copy and paste

71
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:38,979
and call this xr for Rate.

72
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:42,572
When you're doing this, you
need to be very careful.

73
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:47,347
And so now I'm gonna calculate xp

74
00:03:47,347 --> 00:03:53,265
which is xh times xr,

75
00:03:53,265 --> 00:04:01,449
and then I'm gonna say print ("Pay:",)

76
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,593
I don't need to put a space

77
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:07,604
because this comma effectively
creates a space, xp.

78
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:10,419
And then I'm gonna save that.

79
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm gonna switch to my terminal program,

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,950
clear my screen in my terminal program,

81
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,745
and I'm gonna type up arrow,

82
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:23,838
because I already typed
python3 ex_02_03.py

83
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:26,813
so my Hours, I'll just start
with something really simple

84
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:31,913
that I can calculate in
my head, 10 and five.

85
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,422
Whoops.

86
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:42,446
"can't multiply sequence
of non-int of type 'str'".

87
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:44,202
Here we have a traceback

88
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:48,285
and again, I encourage you to
realize that these tracebacks

89
00:04:48,285 --> 00:04:52,030
are not personal attacks by Python on you

90
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,791
even though they might
be frustrating. (sighs)

91
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,976
So the way to parse this
is start by saying line 3,

92
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:00,484
something's wrong at line 3.

93
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:02,606
It's pretty good at
knowing what line it is

94
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,791
or it's either that line
or the line above it,

95
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:09,546
and it's something about multiplying.

96
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:12,322
What it's really saying is, "I'm confused.

97
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:13,218
"I have to stop

98
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:15,751
"because I cannot understand
your instructions."

99
00:05:15,751 --> 00:05:19,621
So the problem here, of course, is that

100
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:20,969
this is of type string

101
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:25,376
and so you can't multiply a
string times a string, okay?

102
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:30,438
So we can convert this using a float,

103
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:31,510
so that's a function call now.

104
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,750
We're passing the string xh
in and the value we get back

105
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,873
is the floating point version of that

106
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:42,360
and then we call float for this as well.

107
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,354
Now I'll save that,
always remember to save.

108
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,332
So I'm gonna run it.

109
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:53,325
I'm gonna run my Hours
of 10 and my Rate of 10,

110
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:56,514
and it's 100, and so
that looks pretty good.

111
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,719
So let's go ahead and try to
run this in the Autograder,

112
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:00,592
and this is my idea, is you'll take this,

113
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:05,802
and you'll copy it, and you'll
go back to the Autograder now

114
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:09,108
and just paste this in.

115
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:12,422
And so it says, "Use 35
hours and a rate of 2.75."

116
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,849
So let's check the code.

117
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,627
35 hours, OK.

118
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,415
75.

119
00:06:19,415 --> 00:06:20,720
Oh no, 2.75.

120
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,927
Two point seven-five.

121
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:25,016
And so it's running, and it's
running, and it's running,

122
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,321
and it works!

123
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,196
And, of course, now I've got my Grade.

124
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:30,687
So this idea where you work here

125
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,893
to get your assignment done correctly

126
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,160
and then you run it in the Autograder

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,851
is the way I intend for you to do it,

128
00:06:36,851 --> 00:06:39,667
but again, if you can't do it that way,

129
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:40,728
it's a great way to get started

130
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,605
to just write your code in the Autograder.

131
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:45,786
And, you know...

132
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,257
You can change your code in the Autograder

133
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:48,155
and then run it again.

134
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:50,242
Of course, this is gonna fail.

135
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,879
35.

136
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,507
And 2.75.

137
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:00,280
And of course you get a Mismatch,
and now it's angry at you.

138
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,705
The Mismatch here of course

139
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:05,218
is because I print Howdy Pay in Pay,

140
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:06,486
and it's real picky
about it, and you think,

141
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:09,263
"Oh, I got the 96.25 right."

142
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,933
Well, it doesn't really
care so much about that.

143
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,869
So let me go ahead and fix this and run it

144
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,877
so we leave on a successful note!

145
00:07:19,877 --> 00:07:23,220
35 hours

146
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,192
and 2.75 as the rate per hour.

147
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,542
That's kind of a low rate per hour.

148
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,662
And we're getting successful

149
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:32,839
and of course that means that you now have

150
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,920
a grade on Assignment 2.3.

151
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,488
Look at that, I got a
grade on Assignment 2.3.

152
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:38,832
Unless, of course, you're running this

153
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:41,197
in some other environment, okay?

154
00:07:41,197 --> 00:07:42,665
Thank you so much

155
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:46,332
and I hope that this
has been useful to you.
