00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,480
hi I'm Guido van Rossum I created the

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,030
Python language I have worked on Python

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,160
for 25 years and I've worked with a

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,410
large group of others of course in the

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,840
Python community I'm very excited to see

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,560
you all in this class and I'm very proud

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
that you're using my language to learn

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,310
that your teacher is teaching you I

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,189
phone is just the first step you're

10
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,820
setting on the path to programming there

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,860
are many exciting things to learn in

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,550
programming many that you can learn

13
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,890
using Python many that you can learn

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,280
using other things and you won't be

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,440
alone there will be millions of people

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,620
who have gone before you or who are

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,649
learning Python at the same time as you

18
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,770
and you you can help each other and you

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,399
can learn together
