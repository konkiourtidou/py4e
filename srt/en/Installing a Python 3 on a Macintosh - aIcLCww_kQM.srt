00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:09,677
- [Instructor] In this video,

3
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,549
we're going to actually
download and install

4
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:15,120
Python 3 from Python.org on a Macintosh.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,314
Your Macintosh, for years,

6
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:19,973
has wonderfully come with Python 2.

7
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:23,557
So, if I type python minus minus version.

8
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:28,371
Then, I type that, I see
that I've got Python 2.0.

9
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,856
What we want to do is, in
addition, install Python 3.

10
00:00:31,856 --> 00:00:35,739
One of these days, Macintosh might upgrade

11
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:38,886
their distributed version of Python 3,

12
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,629
but there's so many things inside Mac

13
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:42,187
that depend on Python 2.

14
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:45,208
I'm going to expect that it
will always be named Python 3,

15
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,275
which is what we're gonna call it.

16
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:49,316
In a second.

17
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:52,680
So, here I am at the Python.org downloads

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,405
and I'm gonna download Python 3.

19
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:58,203
You click here, and I've
actually got it sitting here

20
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:01,502
in downloads already
cause I always do that.

21
00:01:01,502 --> 00:01:06,255
And so, so I'm gonna install this.

22
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,208
There is the installer.

23
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,328
And say continue, continue, continue,

24
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:13,038
of course I agree I read
all that really fast.

25
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,940
And now I'm going to install it.

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:22,919
(light piano music)

27
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:29,184
Okay, so now that means
if I run a terminal,

28
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,760
so this is of course
is start run terminal.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,176
So Python 2 is still there,
but Python 3 is also now there.

30
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:40,395
So we should have Python 3 installed,

31
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:42,494
so we installed Python 3.6.

32
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:44,386
And so there we go,
and that's all it takes

33
00:01:44,386 --> 00:01:47,905
to install Python 3 on the Macintosh.

34
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:52,159
So let's write our first
little Python program.

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,731
I'm going to, I like Atom.

36
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:01,963
And so I've got this Atom
editor, it's Atom.io.

37
00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:05,411
Right here, Atom.io, download
and install the Atom editor.

38
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:08,964
I like it because Atom works the same

39
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:12,011
on both Windows, Max, and Linux,

40
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,799
and it has syntax highlighting

41
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,479
and so I really like things like that.

42
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:21,789
So I'm gonna make myself
a simple Python program.

43
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:23,876
Hello world, like we always do.

44
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,257
Now you'll notice that it's
not syntax highlighting yet,

45
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,676
but I'm gonna do a file, save.

46
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:33,544
Oopsie daisy. File, save as.

47
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,471
And I'm gonna go onto my desktop,

48
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:40,604
and I want to make a folder called py4e.

49
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:46,820
I'm just gonna call this hello.py.

50
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,121
Oh crud, gotta rename it.

51
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,327
Rename it.

52
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,532
I ended up with two dots,
hello.py there we are.

53
00:02:56,532 --> 00:02:59,544
And so now I'm here, and
I'm in my home folder.

54
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:00,909
I can go in my desktop

55
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:03,214
and I can go into that new folder I made,

56
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:06,320
Python for everybody,
and I can see the files.

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,510
Now, there are ways to run this,

58
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,827
and I really want you
to learn the terminal,

59
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,762
so that you really know what you're doing.

60
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,595
And so here we are, we are in
the folder that has the Python

61
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:23,958
and then all we do to run it
is we say python3 hello.py.

62
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,155
And there we go, and of
course this is Python 3

63
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:28,215
cause I'm using parentheses there.

64
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,771
So, instead of double quotes.

65
00:03:30,771 --> 00:03:32,405
But Python 2 is still there

66
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:35,234
and of course if you
just run python hello.py,

67
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:38,859
it'll be a syntax error or not.

68
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,747
It must be they added something.

69
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:43,075
(laughs)

70
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:47,149
Yeah, cause Python is still version 2,

71
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,239
but apparently they allowed print in

72
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,536
of the latest version of Python 2.

73
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:55,186
So, away we go, okay.

74
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:57,369
So again thanks for watching.

75
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:59,740
I hope this was helpful to you

76
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,663
to get Python 3 installed
on your Macintosh.

77
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,580
