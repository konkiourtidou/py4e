00:00:00,345 --> 00:00:02,618
- [Instructor] Hello, welcome
to "Python for Everybody".

2
00:00:02,618 --> 00:00:04,892
I'm Charles Severance, your instructor.

3
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:09,292
And in this short video, we're
going to do exercise 3.2,

4
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:13,038
which is really just a
rewrite of exercise 3.1.

5
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:15,836
We're going to deal with some
error conditions using try

6
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,432
and accept.

7
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:20,438
So let's go ahead and get started.

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,802
But this is a good example of something

9
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:24,438
where you want to start with
the previous assignment.

10
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:27,163
So let's open the file that I did before.

11
00:00:27,163 --> 00:00:31,485
And so this happens to
be right here, ex 03 01.

12
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:35,564
And there's my previous program

13
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:38,060
that I wrote for exercise 3.1.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,971
And let me set myself up with Python,

15
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,475
so I can actually run it.

16
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:47,275
cd desktop, cd py4e.

17
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:48,811
These will get better.

18
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:55,630
cd ex_03_01 ls.

19
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,394
And I can say python3 ex 03 01 dot py

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,177
and you know it works fine
if you give it the right data

21
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:08,040
but if you give it bad
data, ten and T E N,

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,306
it blows up, right?

23
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:12,960
And like always, you're getting tracebacks

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,241
for all kinds of things.

25
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,164
But this one is pretty clear if you slowly

26
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:17,429
but surely don't get mad.

27
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:21,037
Just say, oh line four, what
could be wrong in line four?

28
00:01:21,037 --> 00:01:24,368
Could not convert string to float ten.

29
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:28,234
So what it's complaining
about is on line four,

30
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:31,845
this variable 'sr' which
is the string T E N,

31
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:34,423
the letters T E N,

32
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,190
is not working so this
function is blowing up.

33
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,604
Okay?

34
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:40,408
So that's what it's complaining about.

35
00:01:40,408 --> 00:01:42,867
And that's what we want to deal with.

36
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:43,861
Now when you're using try and accept,

37
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:45,472
you don't want to just put a try.

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,550
You want to limit how much
data that you put in the try

39
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,440
and accept or how much go you
put in the try and accept.

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,834
So, let's get started on assignment 3.2.

41
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:56,357
So the nice thing that we can do here,

42
00:01:56,357 --> 00:02:00,468
is we can say File > Save As,

43
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:04,198
and go up a folder to py for everybody.

44
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:10,426
Make a new folder called ex 03 02.

45
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:17,106
And then save the file as ex 03 02 dot py.

46
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:20,507
Okay, so now make sure, get rid of that,

47
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,994
make sure this is different.

48
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,719
We're in a different
folder, so we're not editing

49
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,070
that old file.

50
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,858
And the first thing I'm going to do is,

51
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:27,863
come on,

52
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:31,455
well I'm going to get rid of
some of these print statements.

53
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:34,548
I mean the code's going to work.

54
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:38,505
Come on.

55
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:41,667
Okay, so the dangerous
line of code is right here

56
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:44,056
and so the problem becomes

57
00:02:44,056 --> 00:02:46,284
how are we going to deal with this?

58
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,745
And, and oh, let me do this as well.

59
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:54,543
So here's, if I do pwd, I'm in ex 03 01.

60
00:02:54,543 --> 00:02:57,920
This could drive you crazy.

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,171
Oh wait, I'm in the wrong folder.

62
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,971
How come this is in the wrong folder?

63
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:09,009
I put the ex 03 01, oh.

64
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:16,938
Why is this in...

65
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:18,656
See, you got to watch this.

66
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,765
I think I'm in the wrong folder.

67
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:27,921
File > Open

68
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:31,550
ex 03 02

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,249
ex 03 02

70
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:35,247
Okay, so now I'm in the right spot.

71
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:36,670
I don't know why that
wasn't showing up right.

72
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,103
But keep your eye on this,

73
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:40,027
especially when you're using file names

74
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:41,458
that are ...

75
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:45,975
So I'm going to, I'm in this ex 03 01.

76
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,501
So I'm going to use a command,

77
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:51,497
and you can use this both
in Windows and in Linux

78
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,662
and in Macs,

79
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:54,288
c d dot dot.

80
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:56,644
And what that does is
that goes up a folder.

81
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,464
Part of the goal of this
course is to teach you

82
00:03:58,464 --> 00:04:00,116
how to use things like this.

83
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:01,345
Just how to use these command lines

84
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:03,575
because to be a programmer,

85
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:04,943
even doing the simplest stuff,

86
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,791
you've got to manipulate files

87
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,976
and you've got to be
able to use command line,

88
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:09,785
you've got to be able
to use all these things.

89
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:12,283
Not every thing is a full
screen clickety pointedy thing.

90
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:13,116
Okay?

91
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:14,870
And so what does c d do?

92
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,613
Well, it looks at this.

93
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:18,552
And it goes up one folder.

94
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,224
So it moved us up into here.

95
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:23,591
And you can see after the cd,
my current working directory

96
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,248
is that and I could do
ls to see the folders.

97
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:29,082
And now I see my new ex 03 02.

98
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:35,015
So say cd ex 03 02.

99
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,727
And part of the being a
programmer is having a lot

100
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,958
of folders with weird names
to organize your stuff.

101
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:42,945
So here we go.

102
00:04:42,945 --> 00:04:47,519
Now we have this file and
this file in the same place,

103
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,615
pwd, this matches this,
that file matches this name

104
00:04:51,615 --> 00:05:02,090
and I can say python3 ex 03 02 dot py,

105
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,656
10 10, okay, so.

106
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:11,180
Now I'm just nervous enough
to want to double check this

107
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,919
and so I will do something like this.

108
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,327
I will say XYZ pay and save
it and then run it again,

109
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:26,879
python3, I don't care about the numbers.

110
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,071
See the XYZ pay?

111
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,894
So now I know I'm in that file.

112
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,637
So I do stuff like this all the time

113
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,783
to triple check that I'm
really working with the files.

114
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,978
So now I'm in this file.

115
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:38,719
And now let me make my mistake again.

116
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,965
Ten, ten, and now there's
my failure, right?

117
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,902
So there's the mistake
and that's the thing

118
00:05:44,902 --> 00:05:45,940
we've got to fix.

119
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,246
So, we have these lines of code.

120
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:50,016
So what you do in Python, when you know

121
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,302
that there's a dangerous set of lines,

122
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,702
and you want to take
out insurance on those,

123
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:58,513
you put them in a tri-catch
block or tri-accept block.

124
00:05:58,513 --> 00:06:00,242
And,

125
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:06,514
now what are we supposed
to say when it blows up?

126
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,831
It says 'error, please
enter numeric input'.

127
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,925
I'll just copy that and paste this.

128
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:14,638
Print 'error, please enter numeric input'.

129
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,488
Make that a little bit wider.

130
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:20,295
Print that out.

131
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:22,171
Now I want to put this
print statement back in.

132
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:25,228
Okay?

133
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:26,747
So here we go.

134
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,700
So now what's going to
happen is that we're going

135
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,576
to come in here, we're going to run these,

136
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:33,820
if they work, we'll skip the
accept block and continue.

137
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,384
If they blow up, then it's
going to run this accept block.

138
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:40,525
So let's run it.

139
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,947
Let's start with a working case.

140
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:42,946
That still works.

141
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:43,953
That's good.

142
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:45,310
It comes and does this extra print that

143
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,718
I've got on line nine.

144
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:49,503
Let's go in the bad case, 10, 10.

145
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:54,702
Okay, so we're going to
parse this a little bit.

146
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:59,742
So it says 'error, please
enter numeric input'

147
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:01,022
but then I still get a traceback.

148
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:03,182
And you're like 'I hate computers'.

149
00:07:03,182 --> 00:07:04,610
Because doesn't this look beautiful?

150
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,724
I've got a try.

151
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:06,723
I've indented.

152
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,302
It looks just like what I saw, right?

153
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:09,625
It's so beautiful.

154
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,866
Why does this computer hate me so badly?

155
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:16,053
Well then take a step back
and say you know what,

156
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:19,107
the computer is admitting
that it's confused

157
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,231
by what you have given it.

158
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,633
And so just look.

159
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:25,337
What line are you mad
about, dear computer?

160
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,672
Line nine, okay let's
take a look at line nine.

161
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:30,229
It's always this line
or the one before it.

162
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:31,947
Almost always.

163
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:34,102
Almost always or it gets it right.

164
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:37,590
It says name 'fr' is not defined.

165
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,621
Hmm, so let's just focus on this.

166
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:41,897
It's complaining about this.

167
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:46,668
And the problem is is
that it came down here.

168
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:50,875
It ran through here.

169
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,694
Came down here, ran through here.

170
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:54,913
And this blew up.

171
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:55,957
That line never ran.

172
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:57,103
That's the line that blew up.

173
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,975
And then it ran this error.

174
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,767
So it never got a varible
or a value in 'fr'.

175
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:05,137
And that's because in
this particular case,

176
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:08,110
we either have to put a new
statement in to make sure

177
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,658
the rest of this code
or we can say you know,

178
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:14,297
if everything is just so bad in this thing

179
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:16,461
and I don't want to continue,

180
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,209
quit basically says do not continue.

181
00:08:19,209 --> 00:08:20,314
Okay?

182
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,684
So when it comes in here, it runs this.

183
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:23,689
It blows up.

184
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:24,691
It come down to here.

185
00:08:24,691 --> 00:08:25,691
It prints this.

186
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:26,769
And it quits.

187
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:28,385
And then it doesn't continue on.

188
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:32,227
So now I can run this again, 10, 10.

189
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:33,226
It works.

190
00:08:33,226 --> 00:08:40,745
10 and T E N, and it fails
exactly the same way.

191
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:42,881
This part here is exactly the same

192
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:45,231
as this part here.

193
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,669
The difference was as
soon as we print this out,

194
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,667
we quit so we don't continue on.

195
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,125
Okay?

196
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,555
So if you're doing really
simple sort of input checking,

197
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:56,035
sanity checking is one of
the things we call this

198
00:08:56,035 --> 00:09:00,103
where just does the data make
sense then don't continue.

199
00:09:00,103 --> 00:09:02,932
If the data doesn't make
sense, if these two statements

200
00:09:02,932 --> 00:09:05,048
don't work then whatever we've been given

201
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,147
is nonsensical data

202
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:12,061
that we're not capable of handling, okay?

203
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:17,530
So that is how to write exercise 3.2.

204
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,231
And I hope that you have found
this little video useful.

205
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,231
And thanks for watching.
