Translating Subtitles
---------------------

You can translate subtitles to a language by copying the 
`.srt` files from the `en` folder into this folder and
translating those files.

It is a manual process for Dr. Chuck to upload the files
so we use the GitHub pull request apprach so we can keep track of when
the subtitles change.
